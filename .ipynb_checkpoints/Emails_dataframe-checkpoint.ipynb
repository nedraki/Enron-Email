      "LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS\n",
      "The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\n",
      "any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\n",
      "the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and\n",
      "all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the\n",
      "loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\n",
      "that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor's share of profits\n",
      "is reduced.\n",
      "\n",
      "All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\n",
      "full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\n",
      "the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\n",
      "non-recourse.\n",
      "\n",
      "USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT\n",
      "The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\n",
      "architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\n",
      "organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike\n",
      "many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\n",
      "Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over\n",
      "the estimated 6 month design and approval period.\n",
      "\n",
      "EARLY LAND COSTS\n",
      "The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\n",
      "represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\n",
      "extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\n",
      "probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase\n",
      "price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\n",
      "monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus\n",

      "improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the\n",
      "improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be\n",
      "for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after\n",
      "completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should\n",
      "expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot\n",
      "improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an\n",
      "irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a\n",
      "development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not\n",
      "spent no interest is charged on these funds.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a\n",
      "finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as\n",
      "high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000\n",
      "per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, 'fiscals' at\n",
      "$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000\n",
      "which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to\n",
      "obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement\n",
      "provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the\n",
      "improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would\n",

      "tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can\n",
      "significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total\n",
      "lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably\n",
      "$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The\n",
      "improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design\n",
      "costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and\n",
      "landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for\n",
      "undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would\n",
      "estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the\n",
      "loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give\n",
      "you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required\n",
      "of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing\n",

      "CONSTRUCTION LOANS\n",

      "in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any\n",
      "construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too\n",
      "difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for\n",
      "pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will\n",
      "be from 80% to 95% of value.\n",
      "\n",
      "DISBURSEMENTS\n",
      "Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and\n",
      "near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority\n",
      "payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner\n",
      "will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the\n",
      "fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to\n",
      "15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.\n",
      "These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to\n",
      "calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership\n",

      "to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or\n",
      "cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this\n",
      "function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain\n",
      "from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.\n",
      "Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is\n",
      "used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own\n",
      "any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track\n",
